# HUMAN-POSE-ESTIMATION-USING-ML
Overview
This project is developed as part of the Microsoft & SAP AICTE Internship focusing on AI Technologies. The internship is designed to enhance foundational AI skills and provide real-world project experience. The objective of this project is to implement human pose estimation using OpenCV and Streamlit, enabling users to detect and visualize human poses in images.

The system utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to detect 19 key body parts in an image, such as the head, shoulders, elbows, knees, and more. These body parts are then connected to form a skeleton-like structure that visually represents human poses. The project leverages OpenCV for image processing and pose visualization, while Streamlit provides an easy-to-use web interface for users to interact with the system.
